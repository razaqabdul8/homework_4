A web development exercise in which an app that is to be run in the browser is developed and features a dunamically updated HTML and CSS powered unit that is powered by a javascript code that consits of a clean and polished user interface and is responsible in that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. All of these featuers are included throughout the html, css, and javascript files that are included. The quiz is developed using multiple javascript techniques including the creation of a variable designated as an object that contains quiz questions and answers, variables of a global scope that exist outside of integral functions, functions that cycles/loops through the object array containing the quiz questions to generate the questions and answers, string conversion functions for the rendering of the highscores as taken from an array stored on local storage, functions for the confirmations of each answer to every attempted question (given that all may not be completed in the allocated time as permitted by the timer after which the quiz is automatically terminated), a function that produces a timer whose interval within which the quiz must be complete, and finally a function that sets all the variables back to their original values and shows the home page to enable replay of the quiz.
